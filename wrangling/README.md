Data Wrangling
===============

Overview
---------------

This homework focuses on the first steps of getting data into a usable form to start asking very simple questions.  We'll start asking more complicated questions very soon!

This homework should not be very difficult if you can program in Python.  If this homework is particularly challenging, you may not have enough of a programming background for the course and need to quickly get up to speed or consider another course.

This program will be autograded.  That means that it's important to not change function names and to not add additional functionality that may improve the program but produce different results.  Make sure that your unit tests pass.  This what a successful set of unit tests will look like:

    $ python3 tests.py
    .....
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 5 tests in 0.002s
    
    OK

If you do not get this result from running the tests, you will not get a good grade.
